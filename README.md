# Face-Mask-Detector
COVID-19: Face Mask Detector with OpenCV, Keras, and Deep Learning
n this project:
1. I loaded the face masks detection dataset from disk, trained a model (with Keras and using the pre-trained MobileNet V2 architecture and its weights) on this small dataset, and then saved the face mask classification model with accuracy = 99.7 % (where the Transfer learning technique improved the accuracy by 6%).

2.  loaded the face mask classification model, and then classifying (with OpenCV) each face in the image as Mask or no_Mask.
